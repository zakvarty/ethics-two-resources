_Multi-Armed Bandits:_

Multi-armed bandits can be viewed as an extension of A/B testing to a greater number of options (arms) where the probability of each option being shown to the user adapts as we gather more information. These techniques will be explored in detail during the Reinforcement Learning module next year.
